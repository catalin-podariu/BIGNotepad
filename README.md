# BIGNotepad
============
First serious project in java, ready to be shown to the world.. Basically a plain-text editor, with some advanced features: uses a Mapped Byte Buffer and NIO Channels to open large or unusual files, compound-undo/redo, remembers preferences and displays a line-number. It will soon have an advanced search engine (regex, incremental search, highlights and more).
