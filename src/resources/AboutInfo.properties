aboutAuthor= Hello, my name is Catalin Podariu.. and I am a java rookie!\n[you hear in the background, mellow voices: "Hello Catalin.."]\n\nI've started recently to learn java. About a year ago.. I've done a\nfew small projects, too small to show anyone and I've decided to \nmake something worth showing to the world.\n\nAnd I get that you'll look at this with unimpressed eyes, but I\npromise you that I've worked my fingers to the bone, I've struggled\nand worked with blood and sweat and tears for this thing.. It may not\nlook like much when you're 'up there' but 90% of the things here I've\ndone for the first time.. and looking for answers on forums and google\nis fine, until you have to customize. Then you find out how little you know\nand you start digging some more, you have to stray away from\nthe matter at hand.. in order to understand other things, until you can\ngrasp what you need, for the thing you were looking for in the first\nplace. But the odd part is that.. it's all worth it. \nIt's.. like a super-power.\n\nHaving this said, I'm waiting for your feedback now..\n\nhttps://github.com/catalin-podariu/BIGNotepad  \nhttps://ro.linkedin.com/in/catalinpodariu

thanks=I should thank you..<br>If I'd be speaking to a crowd.. they'd know who they are. And let me assure you, they're not too many! :) So, thank you! I needed *that* said to me. It got me here! <br><br>Nonetheless I want to thank LittleLadyBug.. She is the only one who actually seemed interested in my \"java stories\" :) <br> Catalin -- September 2015
